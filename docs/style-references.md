# UI Style References (with Motion)

Use these products as inspiration for layout, density, and polish (not branding).

## Primary References

- Rippling (enterprise admin polish, clear layout)
- Linear (clean UI, subtle motion, great spacing)
- Notion (information clarity, hierarchy)
- Vercel Dashboard (developer-friendly, minimal UI)

## Motion References (Style)

- Linear: subtle transitions, crisp interactions
- Notion: calm and minimal animation
- Modern SaaS dashboards: fade/slide page transitions, smooth drawers

## Design Characteristics to Emulate

- Clean left navigation with icons and labels
- Clear page headers with contextual actions
- Dense but readable tables
- Calm, neutral color palette
- Structured forms with clear validation
- “Feels expensive” SaaS UI

## Avoid

- Overly colorful dashboards
- Gimmicky animations
- Chat-style interfaces
- Over-emphasizing AI visuals
- Heavy gradients or motion backgrounds

The UI should communicate trust, clarity, and control — and use motion to guide and delight lightly.
